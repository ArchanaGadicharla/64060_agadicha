###QUESTION
###Heart Start produces automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in each of two different plants (A
and B). The unit production costs and monthly production capacity of the two plants are
indicated in the table below. The AEDs are sold through three wholesalers. The shipping cost
from each plant to the warehouse of each wholesaler along with the monthly demand from each
wholesaler are also indicated in the table. How many AEDs should be produced in each plant,
and how should they be distributed to each of the three wholesaler warehouses so as to minimize
the combined cost of production and shipping?

Problem Overview:
Production Sites: Plant A and Plant B
Distribution Centers: Warehouse-1, Warehouse-2, Warehouse-3

Production Costs:
Plant A: $600 per unit produced
Plant B: $625 per unit produced

Shipping Costs:
From Plant A to:
Warehouose-1: $22
Warehouse-2: $14
Warehouse-3: $30
From Plant B to:
Warehouse-1: $16
Warehouse-2: $20
Warehouse-3: $24

Monthly Production Limits:
Plant A: 100 units maximum
Plant B: 120 units maximum

Monthly Demand:
Warehouse-1: 80 units required
Warehouse-2: 60 units required
Warehouse-3: 70 units required

Decision Variables:
Let Y11, Y12, Y13 denote the number of units transported from Plant A to Warehouses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Similarly,
Let Y21, Y22 And Y23 denote the number of units shipped from Plant B to the same Warehouses.

Objective Function:
Our goal is to minimize the combined costs of production and transportation, expressed as follows:
Minimize 
𝐶=(600+22)𝑌11+(600+14)𝑌12+(600+30)𝑌13+(625+16)𝑌21+(625+20)𝑌22+(625+24)Y23C=(600+22)Y11+(600+14)Y12+(600+30)Y 13+(625+16)Y21+(625+20)Y22+(625+24)Y23

Simplified, this becomes:
Minimize 𝐶=622𝑌11+614𝑌12+630𝑌13+641𝑌21+645𝑌22+649𝑌23C=622Y 11+614 Y12+630 Y13+641 Y21+645 Y22+649 Y23

Constraints:
(1) Production Capacity Constraints:
Y11+Y12+Y13 ≤100 (Capacity limit for Plant A)
Y21+Y22+Y23 ≤120 (Capacity limit for Plant B)

(2) Demand Constraints:
Y11+Y21 ≥ 80 (Demand at Warehouse 1)
Y12+22 ≥ 60 (Demand at Warehouse 2)
Y13+23 ≥ 70 (Demand at Warehouse 3)

(3)Non-Negativity Constraints:
Yij ≥ 0 for all i,j

### CONCLUSION
The transportation model for Medical Pulse has been successfully optimized using linear programming, allowing for the cost-effective distribution of life-saving devices from two facilities to three distribution centers. Facility Plant A will produce 100 units, while Facility Plant B will produce 120 units, satisfying all monthly demand requirements while adhering to production capacity constraints. The resulting minimized total cost for both production and shipping is $132,790, highlighting the efficiency gains achieved through this model. This optimized approach not only streamlines Medical Pulse's logistics operations but also enhances resource allocation and cost savings. By reducing operational expenses and meeting customer demand reliably, Medical Pulse strengthens its competitive position in the healthcare market, enabling it to deliver essential devices more effectively.
